# Todo List Application Requirements

## Phase 1: Command-Line Interface (CLI)

### Architecture:
*   **Presentation Layer (CLI):** Interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) using the `questionary` library. Handles user input, displays tasks, and manages interactive selections.
*   **Business Logic Layer (Core Engine):** `TaskManager` class (or similar) responsible for all task management operations (add, get, update, delete). This layer will be independent of the UI and reusable for the GUI phase.
*   **Data Persistence Layer (Storage):** Tasks will be stored in a simple JSON file (`tasks.json`).

### User Interaction (TUI):
*   **Application Start:**
    *   Run `python todo.py`.
    *   The terminal will clear and immediately display the current list of tasks.
    *   A prompt will appear at the bottom, waiting for user input.
*   **Default Action (Add Task):**
    *   Any input typed at the prompt that *does not* start with `/` will be treated as a new task description.
    *   Pressing Enter will add the task, and the displayed task list will refresh.
*   **Special Commands (Starting with `/`):**
    *   Users type a command starting with `/` and press Enter.
    *   **`/complete`**:
        *   Toggles the completion status of a selected task.
        *   After typing `/complete`, an interactive selection menu of tasks will appear.
        *   Users navigate with arrow keys and press Enter to select a task.
        *   If the task is incomplete, it will be marked as complete. If it is already complete, it will be marked as incomplete.
        *   The task list will refresh.
    *   **`/delete`**:
        *   After typing `/delete`, an interactive selection menu of tasks will appear.
        *   Users navigate with arrow keys and press Enter to select a task to delete.
        *   The task list will refresh.
    *   **`/edit`**:
        *   After typing `/edit`, an interactive selection menu of tasks will appear.
        *   Users navigate with arrow keys and press Enter to select a task to edit.
        *   A prompt will ask for the new task description.
        *   The task list will refresh.
    *   **`/flush`**:
        *   Removes all completed tasks from the list after a confirmation.
    *   **`/search`**:
        *   Prompts the user for a search term.
        *   Displays a list of tasks that fuzzy-match the search term.
    *   **`/exit`**:
        *   Closes the application.

### Dependencies:
*   `questionary` library for interactive TUI elements.

## Phase 2: Graphical User Interface (GUI)
*   To be developed after the CLI is completed.
*   Will reuse the Business Logic Layer (`TaskManager`).
*   Specific GUI framework and design to be discussed later.
